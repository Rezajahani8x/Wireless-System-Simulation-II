# Wireless-System-Simulation-II
In this project a narrowband wireless system is simulated. In addition, an OFDM system for transmitting a message is designed and implemented.

This project is based on 2 different section.

- Section 1
  * In this section a narrowband wireless systme is simulated.
  * Employing different modulations, the performance of the system is observed.
  * Diversity approach for enhancing the system's performance is implemented.
 
- Section 2
    * In this section, it is assumed that the channel is frequency selective.
    * For this purpose, a message is aimed to be transmitted via OFDM approach.
    * First, the parameters of the OFDM system is calculated according to the parameters of the channel.
    * The system is implemented employing different modules in the system listed as below:
          1) Waterfilling approach
          2) Space Diversity
          3) Zero-Forcing and MMSE Equalization
          4) It is assumed that a clipping is performed due to the presence of amplifiers.
